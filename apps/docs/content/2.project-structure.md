# Project Structure

Nuxt Fable has both a module (`@nuxt-fable/module`) for parsing your components and stories, as well as a layer (`@nuxt-fable/layer`) built on top of the module to render your stories. We recommend just using the layer, but have separately published the underlying module for those who wish to get their hands dirty.

## Directory Structure

Our layer does necessitate using the `pages/` directory rather than an `app.vue`. We recommend the following structure

```
components/
  example.vue
pages/
  index.vue
stories/
  example.story.tsx
nuxt.config.ts
```

::alert{type="info"}
we also support (and recommend) using `srcDir`. For `srcDir: './src'` you would place `components/`, `pages/`, and `stories/` in `src/` and adjust your `nuxt.config.ts`
::

::list{type="info"}
- The `stories/` directory is where you [write Stories](/writing-stories).
- The `pages/` is the standard [Nuxt pages directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages).
- The `components/` is the standard [Nuxt components directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components).
- The `nuxt.config.ts` is your [Nuxt configuration](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/configuration).
